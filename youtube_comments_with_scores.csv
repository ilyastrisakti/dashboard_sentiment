"u.s government intelligence attempted to homicide as a child then continues abusive psychological approaches to fish for the assumptions ideas and thoughts of the victim they have tried to homicide as a child:





abusive psychological techniques used on vulnerable populations with u s government intelligence surveillance. purposely inflicting mental disruption then referring to it as intrusive thoughts. here are some events that involved abuse of federal intelligence power and resources & threatening display of power:

michael quijano a navy recruiter who had a child with a black woman and was stationed by the navy to clark airforce base philippines '80s. at this time federal intelligence evaluated the navy recruiter as lustful and determined his relationship to the black woman was pure lust and not sincere. federal intelligence cia then used analyst intelligence eavrsdropping conversations to evaluate each parent and had the parents follow abusive instructions on their child so that later the years of influential scenarios and situations would structure psychological harm into the victim by strategizing years of situations and obtain personal information to be applied in inflict paranoia and confusion. this was the intelligence agency initial plan before the internet was ever created. today fbi cia participates in hacking and harrassment by using the established surveillance which was applied onto both the ex-wife and the navy recruiters family. federal intelligence uses the surveillance hacking to strategic observe and determine the best psychological influential bait to use on the victim that the agency refers freely as a "" n*gg*r. 

various psychological approaches are used to determine the best way to traumatize the victim who they attempted to homicide as a child and which the cia fbi staff refers to as a n-word then communicates to others remotely that the victim they want to murder through abusive forms of psychological approaches is that the victim they want to traumatize is confused. the federal intelligence uses their surveillance and eavesdropping equipment to attempt homicide with u.s government clearance to apply abusive psychological approaches and ongoing surveillance while referring to the victim they abused as a child as a n*gg*r. 
( fact - conroe texas michael quijano was under instructions to bring the black woman and black child to the feed store. federal intelligence communicates to michael that his black wife and the black child are animals)

( fact : michael quijano was paired with younger woman tammy busch) 

school used to have the black child be intimidated by affluent environment was called castle hills first baptist school. now school is referred to as christian school at castle hills

use of movie references because federal intelligence observed evaluated and considered the father or mother as a pair of actors insincere in their relationship. so movies are applied onto the couple as research investigation to protect an agency who supports the use of psychological practices to inflict harm into the victim they originally attempted to homicide as a child and now refers to the victim as a n*gg*r. as the agency presses for the victim to interact with them so they can evaluate and determine the ideas, assumptions and mood of the victim so they can observe ways to apply abusive psychological approaches and practices by remotely communicating to those around the victim they have attempted to homicide since 1980 before the internet was ever created.

today i still experience constant use of surveillance hacking and remote hidden communication to others who assist federal intelligence in forming traumatic results onto the test subject /victim.",@AshleyQuijano-p9o,2024-10-21,06:01:27Z,-37
"#2 although i think i'm being a bit off-topic, i think something like that can also be good for workplace issues. i.e., if your manager is upset with you, think of it from their perspective. or, if you are a manager, think of it from the employees perspective.

it can be amazing how often even some empathy can make a world of difference.

e.g., saying something like ""i have to do (insert task no-one wants to do, but is essential) sometimes as well and it's annoying but it's one of those really important that someone does it and right now, you're the only one that can it.""

i.e., just showing that yes, their feelings are valid, but we all need to do things maybe we shouldn't have to do, but they still need someone to do them and we happen to be that person. yes, it's sucks, but, to use one example, we are here to work and not play. maybe some work is something you shouldn't have to do, but right now isn't the right time to discuss this.

another example can be if an employees responds in a way that seems to be an angry/offended manor, rather then take a how dare you attitude, taking a 'i didn't mean to offend' attitude can work a lot better. sometimes, they might even be upset with themselves for being or sounding angry or and calm down and apologize right away. will it always work? i doubt it, but i think it's better then escalating it.",@ExplodingConsole,2024-10-10,06:42:24Z,19

"the ignorance in this video behind the belief of violent breeds. there is some truth to this point but it's not about picking a "" violent breed"" because they're a violent person. pitbulls are known to be one of the more aggressive breeds but when i raised a pit bull she ended up being the sweetest thing on the face of the planet. if an aggressive owner owns a normally docile breed of dog that normally docile breed of dog will be a hostile dog i believe is the true point behind this part in the video",@matthewvoorhies7840,2024-08-14,18:05:14Z,-13

"government intelligence studies behavior patterns and uses the results to change or provoke their victims.

u.s intelligence attempted homicide of a negro child in 1982. u s intelligence continues to monitor documents the events situations of the black crossdresser in san antonio texas to form ways to mentally provoke and overwhelm the minority in which they refer to the minority as a schizophrenic n*gg*r by their cyber division. the cia uses inner ear communicators to listen to conversations to determine the unspoken intentions of those they secretly listen to. the cia fbi supports a filipino man who was once married to a black woman and who originally attempted to homicide her negro child in the philippines. 2nd attempted homicide being conducted by isolating the minority and mentally provoking the individual by involving spies informants and making subtle suggestive threats through the use of intelligence resources and spying. 
- should those individuals without the resources knowledge or assistance to be concerned that an governmental intelligence surveillance agency is attacking them?
any person should be worried. especially if the psychological approach is to cause the person to wonder and ask questions while the intelligence teams observe the results of their thought provoking tactics do harm to defenseless minorities",@AshleyQuijano-p9o,2024-08-02,16:39:41Z,-1

"is there a reason to be happy?

a reason to be happy is that we are coming closer to the point where we can rise above our inborn egoistic desire, which makes us wish to enjoy for self-benefit alone, and which is the cause of all the negative phenomena in our lives since it can never be genuinely fulfilled. by rising above our egoistic desire, we rise to the desire of love and bestowal, i.e., to the quality of nature itself. then, out of our balance with nature's very own quality, we draw the positive forces dwelling in nature that fill us with a genuine sensation of happiness.

that is how we are designed. therefore, anyone who wishes to achieve genuine happiness needs to connect themselves with that very aspiration in others, and which dwells in nature, and then they will attract nature’s positive forces that will enliven and uplift them.

whether we are happy materially or spiritually depends on the desires that we fulfill. material happiness comes from filling our desires to receive pleasure. spiritual happiness, however, comes from discovering and filling the desires to bestow. the difference between these two kinds of desires is like the difference between heaven and earth.

by receiving spiritual pleasure, we feel ourselves above time, space and motion, i.e., we enter a state where there exists no time, place, movement or changes. we simply rise above matter, above our material world that is based on our egoistic desires to enjoy for personal benefit alone. we then gain tremendous fuel and energy to continue our journey toward harmony with each other and nature.

let us hope that we all succeed in attaining such spiritual happiness.",@saracohen7577,2024-06-03,06:10:22Z,40
"how common is it that people have a face that they are showing and a face that they are hiding when it comes to two-faced behavior? many years ago i met a girl from the philippines who turned out to be a liar and a fraud. but those few of her friends that i have managed to come in contact with have all said the same thing ""that doesn't sound like maria are you certain that you have been talking to the right person"" what would the odds be that maria would be all sweet and kind towards her real life friends and relatives, while being a compulsive liar online? when she and i met she told me that she had just graduated from nursing school,  but some 2 years later there was a post on her third or 4th facebook profile that said ""i have just graduated from the lyceum of iligan foundation college, i want to thank all of my friends and family for their help and support during these 4 amazing years"" but there were no photos from the graduation cermony or graduation party or how she on another of her many fb profiles claimed that she graduated from a school called st michael's college highschool located in adelaide, australia. what would the odds be that maria would only be telling these tall tales online while being good and honest in real life?",@CharlesRaines4946,2024-05-15,23:42:00Z,20

would you be impressive to help the best behaving individuals of all time?

i publicly stand up for the best behaving little children,best behaving individuals,best behaving sons,best behaving daughters,best behaving mothers,best behaving fathers,best behaving grand mothers,best behaving grand fathers,best behaving aunt's, best behaving uncle's,best behaving great aunt's,best behaving great uncles,best behaving great grand mothers, best behaving great grandfathers, best behaving friends,best behaving strangers,best behaving white house employees,best behaving c.i.a. employees,best behaving n.s.a employees,best behaving f.b.i employees and so on for the best behaving individuals of all time and so on who i mean against who unjustly remote control such best behaving little children,best behaving individuals,best behaving white house employees,best behaving c.i.a. employees, best behaving f.b.i. employees, best behaving n.s.a. employees and so on who i mean. 

we are supposed to be helping each other and the best behaving individuals are exactly who are worthy of standing up for such as it's some of how to correctly respect, honor and so on our strength of the human race is to support our best behaving individuals publicly.

our strength of the human race which is our best behaving individuals of the human race will how i mean publicly stand up for the best behaving little children,best behaving individuals,best behaving sons,best behaving daughters,best behaving mothers,best behaving fathers,best behaving grand mothers,best behaving grand fathers,best behaving aunt's, best behaving uncle's,best behaving great aunt's,best behaving great uncles,best behaving great grand mothers, best behaving great grandfathers, best behaving friends,best behaving strangers,best behaving white house employees,best behaving c.i.a. employees,best behaving n.s.a employees,best behaving f.b.i employees and so on for the best behaving individuals of all time and so on who i mean against who unjustly remote control such best behaving little children,best behaving individuals,best behaving white house employees,best behaving c.i.a. employees, best behaving f.b.i. employees, best behaving n.s.a. employees and so on who i mean. 

so if having the attention of the best behaving individuals and so on i am trying to say something important such as we need behaviors to improve, quality of life to improve and so on not more psychotic mass shootings, psychotic individuals unjustly remote controlling individuals and so on so we should want the best behaving individuals to help with such important topics and it's exactly the best behaving individuals who will publicly stand up for the best behaving individuals and so on how i mean against such dangerous individuals if need be. so i think we should do the best behaviors that we can do so we can help the best behaving individuals of all time improve behaviors and so on how i mean such as by trying to improve our best behaviors, evolution of improving behaviors and so on to help more positivity occur, celebrating life, happiness, honor, respect, caring, loving,fun, inspiring and so on kind of positivity such as to help improve behaviors,life and so on how i mean.

i support amazingly correct behaviors such as freedom of speech concerning doing amazingly correct speech for example. i publicly stand up for the best behaving individuals,best behaving little children of gov. employees,best behaving gov. employees and so on against psychotic individuals who unjustly remote control individuals such as unjustly remote controlling individuals to unjustly torture the best behaving little children of the united states government employees and so on sexually, mentally, physically and so on how i mean. i don't believe in supporting psychotic behaviors as if we should accept that they are behaviors that are acceptable how i mean. some behaviors are not acceptable and speech is behaviors. so i support doing amazingly correct behaviors publicly and having it evolving into more amazingly correct behaviors in the future and it be better and better during life. we don't need more horrible speech such as supporting terrorists, rapists and so on kind of behaviors how i mean. we don't need more bad behaviors of saying to abuse females,males and so on such as we need more of the human race standing up for the best behaving individuals and so on who really contribute to helping life be caring, loving, respectful,fun, happy and so on how i am referring about. i think arts, fitness, imaginative spirituality, benevolence, courage, honor, love, care and such are very important things and we need freedom of speech to help improve such things more and more efficiently and we don't need more and more of freedom of speech of such hate speech how i mean. sure it's important to mention the problem, but we need to support our strength and our strength is the best behaving individuals not bad people so please try to remember to support the amazingly correct behaviors during life more so than to support bad behaviors freedoms how i am referring about. i do believe we need to support more positive things rather than defending bad behaviors. thanks for the positive things you do during life and i hope you each have amazingly awesome life ahead of each of you how i mean and who i am referring about.",@MichaelStugart,2023-02-18,23:28:47Z,166
